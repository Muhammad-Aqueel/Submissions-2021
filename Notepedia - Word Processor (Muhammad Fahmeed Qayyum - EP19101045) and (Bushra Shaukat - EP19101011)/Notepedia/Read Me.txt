Assalam-O-Alaikum Sir, 

1. Icons might not properly be displayed and for the icons to be displayed properly we have to copy the source code and make a new .py file and paste the code to a newly created python file.

2. Python version 3.9.1 currently latest is used for the project (Downloaded from www.python.org)

3. The dependencies should be installed like PyQt5, SpeechRecognition, etc...

4.

INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES

pip install PyQt5
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install PyAudio 
	or
if it is not installing then search for python unofficial binaries and dwnload the pygame wheel file based on the python version currently installed on the system.

5. DONE!!
